Cronó is a time tracking enterprise system that can be used within an organization to help the administration to manage their human capitals. It aims to simplify and reduce the cost of managing the payment process and overseeing time management of staffs in an organisation. It also allows companies to manage freelancers and employees who work remotely at ease. This system should be able to effortlessly integrated into the established enterprise systems (ex. task management system) of an organization, due to its direct relation to its domain and its simplicity.

Cronó was designed for two featured user types, administration (admin) and employees that have different functionalities. The goal of admin users is to be able to manage employees. In order to accomplish this, they are able to add, remove and edit the profile, hours worked and payments of employees. Most importantly, admins should be able to pay outstanding wages of employees. The employee functionality should allow them to reliably and accurately convey their time to the their admin and able to track/view their work and payment history.

The system allows for this functionality by using a dynamic web service created using Java 2 Platforms, Enterprise Edition (J2PEE). It connects a PostGre database to store accounts details and work history.
